Hi guys, I have developed a desktop application to backup your mobile device files such as images and documents to your laptop or computer. It's been a tedious job to search each and every folder for images and documents. This app will search all the folders present in the internal storage of your mobile and load the images and documents separately. From the app, you can copy the images and documents to your desired folder on your PC. There is an option to select a few files and also all the files present in your device. Just open the app, connect your mobile device, if it shows the device not connected, click on try again button, wait for max 30 sec, it will load all the files and you can see it on your screen. It also has sorting functionality where you can sort the files on the basis of Name, Size, and Last-Modified. It is currently only for the Linux system. Just use the application and give feedback. The application will look like stuck sometimes. I have been working on it and it will be fixed very soon. The google drive link to the application is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/136eRKhILjBXd8Gm-3umhBUG9aepm9FaA?usp=sharing. Please use it and share feedback on how it can be improvised.
